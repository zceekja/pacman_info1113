#Control:

# move left  		- A, arrow left  
# move right 		- D, arrow right
# move up    		- W, arrow up
# move down  		- S, arrow down
# pause/continue    - P
# use berry  		- F
# space             - debug mode

# For extension 
# I have berry that player can collect and use anytime to freeze ghosts for 5 second
# I have timer countdown 3-2-1 before game start
# I have pause/continue function
# I have score/ high score, i implement this before additional requrement release. It is pointless now because game end when stage clear.
